This is partly due to</br>\r\ncrop raw files having some apparently extra pixels that are being discarded by the camera's firmware</br>\r\nthus making it difficult to find the actual width and height of the image.</br>\r\nZoom settings are not planned to be supported as well.</br>\r\nAnyway, using crop/zoom setting with RAW have no real benefit, since shooting in full resolution</br>\r\nand then cropping in post-processing will yield identical results.\r\n\r\nQ: Windows returns an error about missing MSVCP140.dll<br/>\r\nA: Install: https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=48145\r\n\r\nQ: Windows reports an error: \"This app can't run on your PC. To find a version for your PC, check with the software publisher.\"<br/>\r\nA: The binary is for 64-bit windows, while you are probably running 32-bit\r\n\r\nQ: Windows is unable to convert files in directory containing non ASCII characters</br>\r\nA: Adobe libraries do not support unicode file names on Windows, so as result the same is true for sjcam_raw2dng\r\n\r\nQ: On Mac OSX GUI does not start<br/>\r\nA: Install wxPython and put sjcam_raw2dng in the same folder as the GUI\r\n\r\nQ: On Mac OSX running the executable results in \"permission denied\"<br/>\r\nA: Type \"cd\" [drag sjcam_raw2dng_v1.0.1_macosx folder here]</br>\r\nType \"ls â€“l\"</br>\r\nHit return.</br>\r\nThen type \"chmod 755\" [Drag the sjcam_raw2dng here]</br>\r\nHit return.</br>\r\n\r\nNow you will be able to etither run the sjcam_raw2dng binary from console</br>\r\nor drag and drop files/folders into the sjcam_raw2dng binary\r\n\r\n",
